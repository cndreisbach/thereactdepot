# React Depot

This application is a repository of information about a curated set of libraries to use with React. It is heavily inspired by [The Ruby Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/).

## TODO

* [ ] Users can sort libraries by score, most recent, most downloaded.
* [ ] Logged in users can add new libraries.
* [ ] Logged in users can save their favorite libraries to a list.
* [ ] Logged in users can get an `npm` or `yarn` command to install all their favorite libraries.

## Standards

* Components should be separated into presentational components and container components.
* Presentational components should not make any Ajax calls.
* [standardjs](https://standardjs.com/) is used for all code.
* Presentational components should be designed using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
* Jest is used for testing and most things should be tested.
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) is used for styling with [Bloomer](https://bloomer.js.org/)
